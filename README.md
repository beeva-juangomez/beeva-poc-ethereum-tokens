### Topic <a name="topic"></a>

To investigate Ethereum ecosystem with focus on token creation and ICOs

### What is Ethereum? <a name="what_is_ethereum"></a>

>Ethereum is a decentralized platform that runs smart contracts.

One of the most interesting things about Ethereum are smart contracts which can be described as highly programmable digital money. Imagine automatically sending money from one person to another but only when a certain set of conditions are met.

Many of the centralized systems we use today could be built in a decentralized manner on Ethereum. With Ethereum you can make these transactions trustless which opens up an entire world of decentralized applications

### What is a Ethereum Token? <a name="what_is_ethereum_token"></a>

Ethereum tokens are simply digital assets that are being built on top of the Ethereum blockchain. They benefit from Ethereumâ€™s existing infrastructure instead of developers having to build an entirely new blockchain. They also strengthen the Ethereum ecosystem by driving demand for ether, the native currency of Ethereum, needed to power the smart contracts.

Ethereum tokens can represent anything from a physical object like gold (Digix) to a native currency used to pay transaction fees (Golem). In the future, tokens may even be used to represent financial instruments like stocks and bonds

### What is a ICO? <a name="what_is_ico"></a>

Tokens are often issued to the public through a crowd sale called an initial coin offering (ICO). The creators of the token will issue the token to others in exchange for ether and sometimes bitcoin and other digital currencies. There have been many ICOs recently and in a short time they have completely changed the way projects are funded. There is no requirement that tokens must be well distributed, although if you are building a decentralized application ideally you want the tokens to be owned by as many people as possible.
